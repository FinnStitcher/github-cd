<!-- 
    CSS and HTML are two different programming languages, but have come to be able to work
    together nicely.

    But in order for them to work together, we need to establish a link.
    This link is always established in the <head> tag of the HTML because the <head> tag is
        meant to hold data/info for the HTML that won't necessarily become visible to the user
        that's on the website.

 -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>

    <!-- 
        Establishing the connection to ONE CSS stylesheet.
        There needs to be a minimum of two attributes 
        1. rel 
            - short for relationship
        2. href
            - Essentially a URL or a path. This URL/path can point to somewhere on the internet or
            to a location somewhere on your computer.
            - In this case we are pointing to somewhere on your local machine.
            - The ""(Double Quotes) are important because this is how HTML understands what we think as written text.
            In Coding terms, there are labeled as ** Strings ** 
            - The reason we start out our String with "./" is because this is the industry standard to say we are starting
            our path search in the folder that we are currently in. Then finally we need the name of the CSS file to finally link it.
        3. Once linked, we can start applying styles to our HTML elements(tags) with CSS Selectors

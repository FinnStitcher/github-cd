        After the CSS is linked, we then need to create our CSS Selectors to be used 
        
        There are many ways to tackle this.
            1. create the CSS attributes first in the HTML. Then in the CSS file, we would add the CSS Selectors.
            2. create the CSS Selectors first in the CSS. Then in the HTML file, create the corresponding HTML elements
                and the corresponding CSS attributes.

        In Terms of Classes and ID's
        ----------------------------
        Regardless of which way we start this Process of testing the CSS and HTML together, 
        we need to have these requirements met.
            1. In the HTML file, have the correct attributes applied to the HTML elements
                - An attribute is what is included in the opening tag of an HTML element
                - There are a whole list of attributes that are built in and you can also
                  set your own attributes as well.
            2. In the HTML file, have the correct name of the CSS Selector set to those attributes
                - The name of the CSS Selector is whatever you decided to name this Selector
                - It can be any name that you choose. But choose a name that makes sense to you
                  when you look back at your code.
            3. IN the CSS File, have the correct CSS Selector syntax along with the correct
                name that matches the HTML file.
                - Class CSS Selector = .
                - ID CSS Selector = # 
                - READ THE CSS FILE for more clarity

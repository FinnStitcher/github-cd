<!-- 
The code down below is the most basic and simplest way to construct a HTML webpage.
If you open this up in the browser, you're going to get an empty page.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>


<!-- 
You always needs these specifc tags in this specific order
- A tag is whatever is inside the greater-than(<) and less-than(>) symbols
- Tags are most likely referred to as
    - Opening Tags = <>
    - Closing Tags = </>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head></head>
    <body></body>
</html>

==============================

The extra tags such as <meta> and <title> are there to help the browser

<!-- 

Semantic Tags for now can be thought of as functionally the same as basic HTML tags 
but with a fancier title(name). The difference is essentially just the name, everything
else about a semantic tag is identical to a basic tag

The biggest reason that semantics continue to be developed is because of quick readability
from dev to devs and because it is now an accessibility requirement established in other countries
like the UK and Europe.
  - So if you're website does not meet their accessibility standards, your website/company is subject
  to the fines or punishment that comes with not having met those standards if any of your client base
  is located in those countries.

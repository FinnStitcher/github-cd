Tags are essentially the building blocks for HTML.
- Also referred to as HTML Elements

Each HTML Element(Tag) are inherently categorized in two types
    1. Block elements
        - The width of the Element(Tag) extends the whole width of it's parent container
        - Current block elements will make the next Element(Tag) start underneath this current Element
        regardless of whether its another block or inline element
    2. Inline elements
        - The width of the Element(Tag) extends only to the width of the content that is inside of the Element
        - Current inline elements will make the next elements appear side to side with the current one

The reason that this is important is because of how the boxes will interact with each other

========================================================================

General Tag creation = <></>
- Opening part of the tag AKA (Opening Tag) = <>
- Closing part of the tag AKA (Closing Tag) = </>
    - Examlples are in the code below

========================================================================

There are self closing tags as well, most likely came about because devs were lazy to type the closing tags

Self-Closing Tag Creation = </>
- No opening and closing tags
    - Examlples are in the code below

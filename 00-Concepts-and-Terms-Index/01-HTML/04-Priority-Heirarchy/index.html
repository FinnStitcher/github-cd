    <!-- 
        HTML is read top-down and prioritized as last-in-first-out
        In simpler terms, the elements at the bottom are prioritized over the ones at the top.
            - Ex. If all the elements were overlayed on top of eachother, the output would be
              similar to a stack of cards but flipped so that the suite and number/face are showing instead.
            - This Priortization becomes more apparent once we introduce CSS into the mix
